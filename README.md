Edits to Eukaryot's [Sonic 3 A.I.R. scripts](https://github.com/Eukaryot/sonic3air) in the form of a mod for [the game.](https://sonic3air.org)
These edits are more notably:

* Redesigned Level Select to refresh the visuals
* Title Screen options to replicate how it looked in different rereleases (with modded sprite support)
* Adding updated versions of my previous mods (LBZ2 Early Sky Fade and Big Arms Tweaks)
* Allowing Super and Hyper forms to get Rings from Invincibility monitors
* A new method of activating the Dropdash before using shield abilities
* Other really niche things   : )

Taking a look inside the scripts is reccomended for those who want to see true insanity. However, do **not** release modifications of them without my premission.

## Looking to help out?
Contact me directly if you want, I'm very open to this kind of stuff. Just know that I won't exactly accept *suggestions* for the mod, rather any fixes, refinements and additions people would like me to include.

## Extra Slots
Extra Mushrooms has "framework" to add support Extra Slot Characters without much of an issue. A tutorial was created by myself to assist others in the process. It can be found [here.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1043403130857062422/1081044498454413382/ExtraMushrooms_ExtraSlot_Tutorial.txt)

## Other things of note
Stuff doesn't work correctly with certain mods. (Exceptions can be seen in scripts, since I either like the mod or it's popular enough for me to add support.) I'm not planning to fix issues related to any other mods unless it's extremely notable and is *worth* fixing.
